phase 1: record the weights at epoch 5
phase 2: start finetuning after pruning from this epoch 5.
This number 5 can vary
---
number of hidden layers
---
number of neurons
---
how many are pruned - how many are kept
---
criteria for keeping and removing neurons
---
batch norms
---
layer norms
---
dropouts
---
